points temporarely, to a maximum of 100 points.
- A buff will display the current style rank from E to S.
- Being hit by an enemy resets the style points to zero.
- Player receives, per rank of style:
- - +5% movement speed; 
- - +20% jump speed;

- Because Master mode is way too hard with DMode, this should makes
things easier for good players, and also more fun.
