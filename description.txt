D-Mode is a single player mod that inserts a bunch of new RPG elements into Terraria:
- A Skill System for tools, weapons and armor.
- An Upgrade System for tools, weapons and armor.
- An Infusion System for weapons. They imbue passive effects.

The current version does not work properly on Multiplayer just yet.
The mod has been designed to be 100% functional only in single player mode.
